# TransAndBert

A repository with:
1. Pytorch code for transformer classifier.
2. Fine tuning of `transformers` library's BERT model to perform classification.

Both the models are trained on IMDB dataset, which consists of 25k training and 25k testing samples. I've considered 5k samples from training data as validation data.
